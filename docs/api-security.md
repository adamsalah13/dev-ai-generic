# API Security Guidelines for ShopFlow

## 🔐 Core Principles

- Enforce JWT-based authentication for customer and admin APIs with short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens stored securely.
- Apply role- and scope-based authorisation aligned with the profile and admin dashboards in the refreshed frontend.
- Validate and sanitise input on every endpoint using shared middleware.

## 🛡️ Defensive Controls

- **Rate limiting**: apply per-IP and per-user policies using Redis-backed limiters.
- **Audit logging**: capture critical operations (orders, refunds, admin actions) with immutable logs.
- **Secrets management**: store API keys in Azure Key Vault; inject via deployment workflows.
- **Transport security**: enforce HTTPS end to end and apply HSTS headers.

## 🔍 Testing & Automation

- Integrate SAST, DAST, and dependency scanning in CI as described in the [DevOps exercise](../personas/devops/exercise-1-ci-cd-pipeline.md).
- Use the [testing strategy](./testing/testing-strategy.md) to schedule API security and chaos test suites.
- Run OWASP ZAP or Burp scans against staging before production deployments.
