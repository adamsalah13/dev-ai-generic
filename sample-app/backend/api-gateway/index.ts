/**
 * Legacy API gateway blueprint
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * This file intentionally preserves the original advanced architecture outline
 * for instructors who want to discuss production-ready patterns (rate limiting,
 * distributed caching, etc.). It is not wired into the lightweight mock backend.
 *
 * Keep this module as documentation onlyâ€”do not import it in the simplified
 * Express server under `src/index.ts`.
