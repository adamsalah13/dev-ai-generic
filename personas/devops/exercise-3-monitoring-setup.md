# Exercise 3: Monitoring & Observability Setup

## üéØ Objective

Design and implement a monitoring stack for ShopFlow that captures health signals, business KPIs, and alerts the team when service levels degrade.

## üìã Scenario

The ShopFlow beta launch is approaching. Leadership wants proactive insight into uptime, performance, and key commerce flows (browse ‚Üí cart ‚Üí checkout). You will extend the IaC foundation to deploy monitoring resources, dashboards, and alerting workflows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Deliverables

1. **Monitoring Architecture**
   - Diagram showing data sources, ingestion, storage, and visualization.
   - Description of chosen tooling (Azure Monitor, Grafana, Datadog, etc.).
2. **Instrumentation Plan**
   - Metrics catalogue (technical + business).
   - Log schema and retention policy.
   - Distributed tracing plan (if applicable).
3. **Dashboards & Alerts**
   - Dashboard JSON or definitions checked into `observability/dashboards`.
   - Alert policies with thresholds, severity, and routing.
   - Synthetic tests for homepage, product detail, and checkout flows.
4. **Runbooks & On-call Guide**
   - Minimum of two runbooks for Sev1/Sev2 incidents.
   - On-call rotation and escalation policy documented.

## ü§ñ AI Workflow

1. Start with the [Monitoring Template](../../templates/devops/monitoring-template.md) to gather context.
2. Prompt AI for metrics/alert recommendations per component (frontend, API, database).
3. Generate infrastructure code or scripts to provision monitoring resources.
4. Ask AI to draft dashboards and alert YAML/JSON, then review manually.
5. Use AI to create concise runbooks with troubleshooting steps and rollback guidance.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `observability/` directory contains architecture notes, dashboards, alerts, and runbooks.
- [ ] Monitoring solution integrates with existing infrastructure (or mocks for local dev).
- [ ] Dashboards include executive overview and on-call deep dive views.
- [ ] Alert routing matches escalation policy and avoids alert fatigue.
- [ ] Synthetic checks cover login, add-to-cart, and checkout flows.
- [ ] Documentation includes maintenance tips and testing strategy.

## üîç Stretch Goals

- Implement SLO calculations with error budgets and burn-rate alerts.
- Add anomaly detection or AI Ops integration.
- Automate dashboard provisioning via CI/CD.

**Timebox:** 3‚Äì4 hours. Coordinate with QA and Support to align alert procedures.
