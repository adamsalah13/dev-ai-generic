- Product range: Physical and digital products
- Average processing time goal: Real-time inventory updates
- Customer experience goal: Seamless browsing and purchasing
- Platform: Web and mobile applications
- Integration: Payment gateways, shipping providers, inventory systems

## ðŸš€ AI-Assisted Tasks

### Task 1: Requirements Analysis with AI

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
Act as a senior business analyst for an e-commerce platform. Analyze the following product management system requirements:

Business Goal: Create an automated product catalog management system that handles product listings, inventory management, and order processing.

Target Users: Small to medium businesses, individual sellers, and customers
Business Objectives:
- Enable easy product listing and management
- Provide real-time inventory tracking
- Ensure smooth order processing workflow
- Support multiple product categories and types
- Provide excellent user experience for buyers and sellers

Generate a comprehensive requirements analysis including:
1. Functional requirements (detailed list)
2. Non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
3. Integration requirements (third-party services)
4. User experience requirements
5. Data requirements and privacy considerations
6. Success metrics and KPIs

Format the output as a structured document with clear sections and bullet points.
```

**Your Task:**
1. Use the above prompt with GitHub Copilot Chat or Cursor AI
2. Review and refine the generated requirements
3. Add specific e-commerce considerations
4. Document the output in `requirements-analysis.md`

### Task 2: User Story Generation

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
Based on the e-commerce product management system requirements, create comprehensive user stories for the following personas:

Primary Personas:
1. Product Seller (new vendor)
2. Product Seller (experienced vendor)
3. Customer (browsing and purchasing)
4. Platform Administrator (system management)
5. Customer Service Representative (order support)

For each persona, create user stories following this format:
"As a [persona], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]"

Include for each story:
- Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then format)
- Priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Story points estimation (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- Dependencies on other stories
- Definition of Done
- Notes about edge cases or special considerations

Focus on the complete product lifecycle from listing to order fulfillment.
```

**Your Task:**
1. Generate comprehensive user stories using AI
2. Review and prioritize the stories
3. Organize into epics and sprints
4. Document in `user-stories.md`

### Task 3: Process Flow Documentation

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
Create a detailed business process flow for the e-commerce product management system. The process should cover:

Main Flows:
1. Product listing and approval
2. Inventory management and updates
3. Order placement and processing
4. Payment processing and confirmation
5. Shipping and fulfillment
6. Returns and refunds
7. Customer support and inquiries

Include:
- Decision points and business rules
- Error handling and exception flows
- Integration touchpoints
- User experience considerations
- Timeline expectations
- Notification requirements

Generate:
1. High-level process flow description
2. Detailed step-by-step process
3. PlantUML diagram code for the process flow
4. Business rules and decision criteria
5. Exception handling procedures
```

**Your Task:**
1. Generate the process flow using AI
2. Create the PlantUML diagram
3. Validate the flow with stakeholder scenarios
4. Document in `process-flow.md`

### Task 4: Data Model and System Integration

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
Design a comprehensive data model and integration architecture for the e-commerce product management system:

Core Entities to model:
1. Users (sellers, customers, admins)
2. Products (catalog, variants, categories)
3. Inventory (stock levels, warehouses)
4. Orders (cart, checkout, fulfillment)
5. Payments (transactions, refunds)
6. Reviews and ratings
7. Analytics and reporting data

For each entity, provide:
- Key attributes and data types
- Relationships between entities
- Validation rules and constraints
- Privacy and security considerations

Integration Requirements:
- Payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal)
- Shipping providers (FedEx, UPS, USPS)
- Email services (SendGrid, Mailgun)
- Analytics platforms (Google Analytics)
- Search engines (Elasticsearch, Algolia)

Generate a structured data model with entity relationships and integration points.
```

**Your Task:**
1. Generate comprehensive data model
2. Create integration architecture diagram
3. Define API specifications
4. Document in `data-model.md`
